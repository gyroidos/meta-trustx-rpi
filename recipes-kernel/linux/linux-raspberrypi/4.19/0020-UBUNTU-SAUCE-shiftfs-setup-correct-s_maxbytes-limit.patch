Subject: [PATCH 20/23] UBUNTU: SAUCE: shiftfs: setup correct s_maxbytes limit

BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1849482

Set the s_maxbytes limit to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE.
Currently shiftfs limits the maximum size for fallocate() needlessly
causing calls such as fallocate --length 2GB ./file to fail. This
limitation is arbitrary since it's not caused by the underlay but
rather by shiftfs itself capping the s_maxbytes. This causes bugs such
as the one reported in [1].
